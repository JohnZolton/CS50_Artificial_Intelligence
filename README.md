Harvard CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

## Week 1 - Search
- [degrees](https://github.com/JohnZolton/CS50_Artificial_Intelligence/tree/main/Week%201%20-%20Search/degrees): uses a breadth-first search to find minimum degrees of separation between two actors (source and target) via their co-stars. Initializes the first actor as a node with their id and adds their co-stars to the frontier. Then explores each movie's stars for the target star and repeats for each of their movies until it finds a connection.
